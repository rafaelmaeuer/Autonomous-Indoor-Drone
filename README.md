# Autonomous Indoor Drone

The goal of this project was to realize an autonomous flying indoor drone.

## Info

The simulation works (only in a fixed horizontal plane), tests on the real drone failed so far, due to problems with FCs, PID-settings and lack of time.

#### Software

This project uses [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and [ROS-Flight](https://rosflight.org/) for sensing and drone control, [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) for simulation, and [ROS-navigation](https://wiki.ros.org/navigation) with [ROS-hector-mapping](https://wiki.ros.org/hector_mapping) for SLAM. The Web-UI is realized with a [Simple Websocket Server](https://github.com/pikhovkin/simple-websocket-server) in python.

#### Hardware

The drone was built with a [Naze32 (F1)](https://www.dronetrest.com/t/naze-32-revision-6-flight-controller-guide/1605) / [REVO (F4)](http://copterjungle.de/f4-revo-stm32f405-flight-controller/) as FC, a [NanoPi Neo Air](https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=151) for onboard computation. A [RPILIDAR A2](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A2) is used for horizontal and two [HC-SR04](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569) ultrasonic sensors for vertical measurements.

## Structure

- [AMS-CC](https://bitbucket.org/ams2019/ams-cc): This repository contains scripts and configurations for the companion computer.
- [AMS-FC](https://bitbucket.org/ams2019/ams-fc): This repository contains firmware and parameters used for the flight controller of the drone.
- [AMS-MAIN](https://bitbucket.org/ams2019/ams-main): This repository contains all code used for mapping, calculations and controls of the drone.
- [AMS-SENS](https://bitbucket.org/ams2019/ams-sens): This repository contains all code used for sensor reading and actuator controlling.
- [AMS-SIMU](https://bitbucket.org/ams2019/ams-simu): This repository contains all code used for simulation of the drone with gazebo.

## Installation

The following repositories are necessary depending on what goal should be achieved:

- Drone Simulation with gazebo: `ams-main`, `ams-simu`
- Autonomous Flight with real drone: `ams-cc`, `ams-fc`, `ams-sens`, `ams-main`

Please follow the instructions of each repository in the given order when trying to rebuild one of the above scenarios.
